Advent of Code solutions. Really just winging it and trying not to use AI.

Solutions are in Ruby, trying for just plain old ruby without any libraries but you can't pry pry away from me ;)

Just run the main file like `ruby solution.rb` or `ruby clean_it_up.rb` in a terminal where you have Ruby installed.

I am using [ASDF](https://asdf-vm.com/) to handle my Ruby versions, a bash shell, alacritty terminal emulator with tmux to open all my windows, and vim as an editor.
